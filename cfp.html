                <p>Both research and industry track papers are solicited. Please make sure that your paper satisfies all the following requirements before being submitted.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format.</li>
                    <li>The submitted manuscripts must describe original work not previously published and not concurrently submitted elsewhere.</li>
                    <li>Submissions must be <strong>no more than 6 pages</strong> in the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE conference proceedings format</a> (two-column, single-space).</li>
                    <li>Each paper will be peer reviewed by the program committee members. Depending on the number of accepted papers, authors of accepted papers may be asked to present either a short or long presentation. It is important to note that authors whose papers are accepted for a short presentation do not need to shorten the paper.</li>
                    <li>Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xploreâ€™s scope and quality requirements.</li>
                </ul>
    
                <!-- <p>The paper submission portal will open soon.</p> -->
                <p><strong>Please submit your paper through the <a href="https://www.conftool.com/nvmsa2025" target="_blank">paper submission site</a>.</strong></p>
    
    
                <p>The review process is <strong>single-blinded</strong>, meaning that the names and affiliations of the authors are visible to the reviewers through the Paper Management System.</p>
                <p>See <a href="https://www.computer.org/web/cs-cps/authors">the IEEE Computer Society Paper Submission Policies</a> for more details.</p>
    
                <p><strong>No Show Policy:</strong></p>
    
                <p>For each accepted paper, one of the author(s) is required to register and attend the conference to present the work. If any author does not give a talk at the conference, the paper will *<strong>NOT</strong>* be included in IEEE Xplore nor EI indexed. Any alternative arrangements require approval by the program chairs. <strong>The default policy does not permit online video presentations</strong>. NVMSA fosters an environment where speakers and attendees interact directly for discussions.</p>
