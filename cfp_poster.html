        <p>The poster session at NVMSA 2025 offers a chance to showcase preliminary work and gather feedback not only from the non-volatile memory systems community but also from the real-time/embedded system community attending RTCSA, which is co-located with the conference. We welcome both research and industry presentations during the poster session, which will take place alongside the welcome reception. NVMSA 2025 invites presentations in the same areas outlined in the Call for Papers.</p>

        <p>Poster submission is limited to a maximum of 2 pages, including all text, figures, tables, appendices, references, etc. Submitted extended abstracts undergo single-blind reviews. The extended abstracts must adhere to the formatting guidelines provided by IEEE conference papers and are included in the proceedings of NVMSA 2025.</p>

        <p>The poster submission portal will open soon.</p>
        <!-- <p>Please submit your poster through the EasyChair <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nvmsa2024" target="_blank">poster submission site</a>.</p> -->
