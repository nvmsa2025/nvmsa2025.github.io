                    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                    <p>As artificial intelligence continues to push the boundaries of scale and complexity, memory systems have become a fundamental bottleneck in achieving efficient and scalable computation. Processing-in-Memory (PIM) has emerged as a compelling solution that shifts computation closer to where data resides to reduce energy, latency, and bandwidth demands. This talk revisits the evolution of PIM technologies developed in our group over the past decade. We will explore analog and digital PIM architectures based on ReRAM, SRAM, and CAM, highlighting their application to neural networks, transformers, graph analytics, and decision trees. Special emphasis will be placed on co-design strategies that bridge algorithm, architecture, and circuit-level considerations, including recent work on attention acceleration, CAM-based matching, sparsity exploitation, and training-aware robustness. Finally, the talk will discuss emerging directions (such as 3D-stacked PIM, hybrid analog-digital arrays, and software-defined PIM systems) that aim to realize practical, scalable, and domain-specific AI acceleration.</p>

                    <h3><b>Title here</b> </h3>
                    <p><b>Speaker: <a href="http://ai.robo.ntu.edu.tw/en/personal.php?id=10">Pei-Chun Lin</a></b>, National Taiwan University</p>

                    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                    <p>Robotic systems are inherently complex, comprising spatial elements such as mechanical structures, mechanisms, and mechatronic assemblies, as well as temporal computational processes including perception, decision-making, and actuation. Achieving versatile and agile behaviors in robotic platforms to meet the demands of diverse operational scenarios necessitates a holistic and well-orchestrated approach to design and integration. This keynote will present recent developments in robotic systems, with a particular emphasis on legged and leg-wheel hybrid locomotion platforms.</p>
                    <p>Drawing inspiration from the dynamic mobility of legged animals, which exhibit remarkable adaptability to unstructured and uneven terrains, this work explores the biomechanical and control principles that inform the design and locomotion strategies of legged robots. In contrast, wheeled locomotion offers advantages in smoothness and energy efficiency, representing one of the most enduring and effective forms of engineered mobility. By integrating these complementary modalities, leg-wheel hybrid robots offer a promising synthesis of adaptability and efficiency.</p>
                    <p>The presentation will address both the design methodologies and control frameworks essential for realizing such multi-modal robotic systems. Emphasis will be placed on system-level integration techniques that enable seamless coordination of mechanical and computational subsystems to achieve robust, agile, and task-flexible robotic behavior.</p>
