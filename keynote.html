                    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                    <p>The conventional wisdom of wireless networking tells us that concurrent transmissions on the same channel from multiple senders colliding at a receiver result in packet loss. However, this is not always true: when transmissions are tightly synchronized, and given power conditions hold, one of the colliding transmissions is nearly always received due to the capture effect. In this talk, we explore the opportunities enabled by this technique in ultra-wideband (UWB) radios, thanks to their unique characteristics. On one hand, concurrent transmissions can be exploited for multi-hop communication, enabling novel network primitives and protocol designs with unprecedented performance and reliability, including network-wide time synchronization with an error of less than 30ns. On the other hand, they can be exploited in conjunction with the distinctive features of UWB: distance estimation and localization. Indeed, UWB transmissions rely on very short pulses; their individual times of arrival can be discriminated in the channel impulse response (CIR) at the receiver. However, the ns-level resolution required for localization poses significant challenges in accurately extracting time information. We report our experience in designing unconventional schemes where a device can simultaneously estimate its distance from several others, or a set of devices can localize countless targets in an area, yielding accuracy comparable to conventional schemes but significantly faster and more energy-efficient operation.</p>

                    <h3><b>Title here</b> </h3>
                    <p><b>Speaker: <a href="http://ai.robo.ntu.edu.tw/en/personal.php?id=10">Pei-Chun Lin</a></b>, National Taiwan University</p>

                    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
                    <p>Robotic systems are inherently complex, comprising spatial elements such as mechanical structures, mechanisms, and mechatronic assemblies, as well as temporal computational processes including perception, decision-making, and actuation. Achieving versatile and agile behaviors in robotic platforms to meet the demands of diverse operational scenarios necessitates a holistic and well-orchestrated approach to design and integration. This keynote will present recent developments in robotic systems, with a particular emphasis on legged and leg-wheel hybrid locomotion platforms.</p>
                    <p>Drawing inspiration from the dynamic mobility of legged animals, which exhibit remarkable adaptability to unstructured and uneven terrains, this work explores the biomechanical and control principles that inform the design and locomotion strategies of legged robots. In contrast, wheeled locomotion offers advantages in smoothness and energy efficiency, representing one of the most enduring and effective forms of engineered mobility. By integrating these complementary modalities, leg-wheel hybrid robots offer a promising synthesis of adaptability and efficiency.</p>
                    <p>The presentation will address both the design methodologies and control frameworks essential for realizing such multi-modal robotic systems. Emphasis will be placed on system-level integration techniques that enable seamless coordination of mechanical and computational subsystems to achieve robust, agile, and task-flexible robotic behavior.</p>
